Deploy a jspsych experiment locally

\details{
The purpose of the \code{run_locally()} function is to start an
R server running (using the plumber package) that will
serve the experiment from the local machine. The \code{path},
\code{experiment_folder} and \code{data_folder} arguments specify the location
specify where the experiment should be deployed, and should be the same
that was used when calling \code{\link{build_experiment}()}) to build the
experiment originally. The \code{port} is the numeric value of the port on
which the experiment is served.
Once \code{run_locally()} has been called, a browser window should open
showing the relevant page.

There are two reasons to deploy a local experiment using \code{run_locally()}
rather than simply opening the relevant "index.html" file in the browser. The
first is for the purpose of saving data. For security reasons, browsers do not
generally permit client-side javascript (e.g., the code that runs the jsPsych
experiment) to save files to arbitrary locations. For this reason writing the
data to file is the job of the R server, not the javascript code that
is running through the browser. In other words, if the experiment is deployed
locally using the \code{run_locally()} function, then the \code{\link{save_locally}()}
function that used to record data locally will work properly. If, however, the
"index.html" file is opened without starting the R server, data will not be
saved to file.

The second reason for using \code{run_locally()} is that it opens up the possibility
that an experiment could use server-side R code at runtime. At the moment jaysire
does not have any functionality to do so, but in principle there is nothing
preventing the R server from playing a more active role when the experiment is
running, and future versions of the package may develop this functionality
further.
