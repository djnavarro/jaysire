Deploy a jspsych experiment on google app engine
}
\details{
The purpose of the \code{run_googlecloud()} function is to make it
somewhat easier to deploy a jsPsych experiment to Google App Engine, so that
the experiment can run in the cloud rather than on the local machine.
The \code{path} and \code{experiment_folder} arguments
specify where the experiment should be deployed, and should be the same
that was used when calling \code{\link{build_experiment}()}) to build the
experiment originally. The \code{project_id} is the name of the Google App
Engine project that will host the experiment.

At present, the functionality of \code{run_googlecloud()} is quite limited. All
it does is construct the appropriate command that you will need to enter at
the terminal. It does not execute that command, nor does it assist you in
creating the Google App Engine project itself (it is assumed that the user
already has a Google Cloud account and is authorised to deploy to the project)
